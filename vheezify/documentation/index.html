                <h2>What is Vheezify?</h2>
                <p>Vheezify is a HWID Spoofer used to bypass the bans handed out by kernel anticheats such
                    as BattleEye, Vanguard, EasyAC, etc. My goal is to make all these anticheats possible
                    to bypass and give out basic knowledge on how they work by reverse engineering them.</p>
            </div>

                <h2>Future of this Spoofer</h2>
                <p>I will continue to update this spoofer depening on how my research into these anticheats and update
                    to my findings excelling this spoofer.</p>

                <h2>Features</h2>
                <p>This HWID Spoofer comes with a GUI that I will be releasing soon. Its spoofs your HWID, GUID, PCNAME, 
                    MAC Address, SMBIOS, Disk Serials, etc. It clears your Valorant and Ubisoft Cache. The GUI is aesthetically pleasing
                    and displays all your System Info to you so you know what has been spoofed.</p>
